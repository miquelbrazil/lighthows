## Description

LightHOWS is a personal project for tracking household tasks. It aims to collect task availability, completion, and process
measurements to provide insights for improving scheduling, delegation, efficency and internal/external compliance.

## Inspiration

LightHOWS was inspired by my curiosity about our trash collection schedule. I thought it would be interesting to create some soft of visiaulize for the following metrics:

1. Record who in the house prepares the trash from which room to be place in the larger liner
2. How long does this process take on a per event basis, but also what is the avarage time for each person and for the entire household
3. What is the spread of time over which all the trash gets collected? (i.e. if the first bag of trash is taken to the liner the day after curbside pickup - start the timer and stop it once all trash for the next curbside pickup is complete.)
4. What time is the trash liner placed at the curb for pickup and by who?
5. What time did the trash collection company show up to collect the trash?
